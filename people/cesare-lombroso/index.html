<h1>Cesare Lombroso</h1>
<h2>Father of Criminology</h2>
<p>Cesare Lombroso (1835â€“1909) was an Italian physician and criminologist whose work laid the foundations of criminology as a scientific discipline. Lombroso sought to understand criminal behavior through biological, psychological, and social analysis rather than purely moral judgment.

In his influential book "Lâ€™Uomo Delinquente" (1876), Lombroso proposed that criminality could be linked to inherited physical and psychological traits. He introduced the controversial concept of the "born criminal," suggesting that some individuals exhibited atavistic features indicative of primitive evolutionary stages.

Although many of Lombrosoâ€™s biological determinist views have been discredited and criticized for ethical and scientific flaws, his broader contribution lies in shifting criminology toward empirical study. He emphasized data collection, classification, and statistical analysis of criminal behavior.

Lombroso also studied social factors, mental illness, and environmental influences on crime, paving the way for later sociological and psychological criminology theories. His work encouraged interdisciplinary research and the use of scientific methods in understanding crime.

Modern criminology rejects Lombrosoâ€™s deterministic conclusions but acknowledges his role in transforming crime study into an academic field. His work sparked debates that ultimately strengthened criminological theory through critical reassessment.

Lombrosoâ€™s legacy is complexâ€”both foundational and cautionaryâ€”serving as a reminder of the need for ethical rigor and scientific humility in criminal research.</p>
