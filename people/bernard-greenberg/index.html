<h1>Bernard Greenberg</h1>
<h2>Father of Forensic Entomology</h2>
<p>Bernard Greenberg (1931â€“2006) was a pioneering forensic entomologist whose research established the scientific use of insects in criminal investigations. Greenberg demonstrated that insect species succession and developmental stages could reliably estimate postmortem intervals, particularly in cases where traditional pathology methods were limited.

Greenberg conducted extensive experimental research on insect colonization of decomposing remains, documenting predictable patterns of insect arrival and life cycle progression. His work provided empirical validation for using entomological evidence to estimate time since death.

One of Greenbergâ€™s most influential contributions was his development of standardized laboratory rearing and identification techniques for forensic insects. These methods enabled accurate species identification and developmental analysis, critical for reliable forensic conclusions.

Greenbergâ€™s research also addressed environmental variables such as temperature, humidity, and geographic location, emphasizing that forensic entomology must account for ecological context. His work helped transform entomology from an observational science into a quantitative forensic discipline.

Today, forensic entomology is used in homicide investigations, mass disaster response, and wildlife crime. Greenbergâ€™s methodologies continue to inform training programs and forensic protocols worldwide.

His legacy demonstrates that even the smallest biological organisms can provide crucial evidence when analyzed scientifically.</p>
