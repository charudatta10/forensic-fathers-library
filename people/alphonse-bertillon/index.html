<h1>Alphonse Bertillon</h1>
<h2>Father of Criminal Identification & Forensic Photography</h2>
<p>Alphonse Bertillon (1853â€“1914) was a pioneering French criminologist whose work laid the foundation for modern criminal identification systems. Before Bertillonâ€™s innovations, law enforcement relied largely on eyewitness testimony and written descriptions, both of which were unreliable and prone to error.

Bertillon developed anthropometry, a systematic method of identifying individuals based on precise measurements of body parts such as head length, arm span, and ear size. This system, known as Bertillonage, was the first scientific attempt to uniquely identify individuals using biometric data. Though later replaced by fingerprinting, anthropometry introduced the core idea that biological characteristics could serve as legal identifiers.

Equally influential was Bertillonâ€™s contribution to forensic photography. He standardized mugshots by introducing frontal and profile photographs under controlled lighting and scale conditions. This practice became the global standard and remains foundational in modern police databases and facial recognition systems.

Bertillon also formalized crime scene photography, insisting that scenes be documented before disturbance. His methods helped preserve spatial relationships between evidence items, enabling reconstruction of criminal events.

Although fingerprinting eventually surpassed anthropometry due to greater reliability, Bertillonâ€™s methodological rigor transformed policing into a data-driven enterprise. His legacy persists in biometric identification, crime scene documentation, and forensic imaging.</p>
