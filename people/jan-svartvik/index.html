<h1>Jan Svartvik</h1>
<h2>Father of Forensic Linguistics</h2>
<p>Jan Svartvik (born 1931) is widely recognized as a founding figure of forensic linguistics, a discipline that applies linguistic analysis to legal evidence such as written texts, spoken statements, confessions, and authorship attribution. His work demonstrated that language contains measurable patterns that can be scientifically analyzed to support legal investigations.

Svartvikâ€™s most influential contribution was his linguistic analysis of the Timothy Evans case in the United Kingdom. By examining police interrogation transcripts, Svartvik demonstrated that portions of Evansâ€™s alleged confession were linguistically inconsistent with his natural speech patterns. This analysis played a critical role in posthumously exonerating Evans and exposing flaws in police interrogation practices.

Svartvik showed that grammatical structure, vocabulary choice, and discourse patterns can reveal authorship, deception, coercion, or fabrication. His work established that linguistic evidence, when rigorously analyzed, can meet scientific and legal standards.

He also contributed extensively to corpus linguistics, developing large linguistic databases that enabled statistical analysis of language use. These methods later became central to forensic authorship attribution, plagiarism detection, and threat assessment.

Modern forensic linguistics is applied in cybercrime investigations, online harassment cases, ransom note analysis, and disputed authorship in digital communications. Svartvikâ€™s methodological rigor and insistence on empirical validation continue to shape the field.

His legacy underscores the importance of language as forensic evidence and demonstrates how interdisciplinary science can correct miscarriages of justice.</p>
