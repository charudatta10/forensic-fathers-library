<h1>Arthur Mourant</h1>
<h2>Father of Forensic Serology</h2>
<p>Arthur Ernest Mourant (1904â€“1994) was a British biologist and geneticist whose work laid the foundations of forensic serology and population genetics. Mourantâ€™s research demonstrated that blood group systems could be used as reliable biological markers for human identification and population differentiation.

During the mid-20th century, before the advent of DNA profiling, blood group analysis represented one of the most powerful tools available for forensic identification. Mourant systematically studied the distribution of ABO, Rh, and other blood group systems across global populations, establishing statistical frameworks for their interpretation in medico-legal contexts.

His landmark book, "The Distribution of the Human Blood Groups," published in 1954, provided comprehensive data and analytical methods that transformed blood group serology from a medical curiosity into a rigorous forensic science. Courts began accepting serological evidence to exclude or associate suspects with crime scenes based on blood typing.

Mourant emphasized probabilistic reasoning and population genetics, arguing that forensic conclusions must be expressed statistically rather than categorically. This probabilistic approach later influenced the interpretation of DNA evidence, making Mourantâ€™s work a conceptual precursor to modern genetic forensics.

Beyond forensic applications, Mourantâ€™s research contributed to anthropology, medicine, and evolutionary biology. He also played a key role in establishing ethical standards for genetic research and data interpretation.

Although DNA profiling has largely replaced classical serology, blood group analysis remains relevant in certain forensic and historical investigations. Mourantâ€™s insistence on statistical rigor and population-based interpretation continues to shape forensic genetics today.</p>
