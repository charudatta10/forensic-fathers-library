<h1>Oscar Amoedo</h1>
<h2>Father of Forensic Odontology</h2>
<p>Oscar Amoedo (1863â€“1945) is recognized as the founder of forensic odontology, the application of dental science to legal investigations. His work established the scientific credibility of dental evidence in personal identification and mass disaster victim identification.

Amoedoâ€™s most influential contribution came after the tragic 1897 fire at the Bazar de la CharitÃ© in Paris, where more than 100 people perished. Amoedo demonstrated that dental records could reliably identify severely burned remains when other methods failed. This landmark investigation proved the value of dental evidence and propelled forensic odontology into mainstream forensic science.

In 1898, Amoedo published "Lâ€™Art Dentaire en MÃ©decine LÃ©gale," the first comprehensive textbook dedicated to forensic dentistry. The book systematically covered bite mark analysis, dental chart comparison, age estimation, and post-mortem dental examination. It became the foundational reference for generations of forensic dentists.

Amoedo emphasized the permanence and individuality of dental structures, arguing that teeth often survive conditions that destroy other biological identifiers. His methodologies laid the groundwork for modern disaster victim identification protocols used by organizations such as INTERPOL.

Today, forensic odontology plays a critical role in mass casualty incidents, missing person cases, and human rights investigations. While bite mark evidence has faced increased scrutiny in recent years, dental identification remains highly reliable when based on antemortem records.

Amoedoâ€™s legacy endures through international forensic odontology associations and standardized dental identification procedures used worldwide.</p>
