<h1>Virginia Lynch</h1>
<h2>Founder of Forensic Nursing</h2>
<p>Virginia A. Lynch (1939â€“2017) was the founder of forensic nursing, a discipline that integrates nursing science with legal and forensic principles. Lynch recognized that nurses often serve as the first point of contact for victims of violence and therefore play a critical role in evidence preservation and documentation.

She established forensic nursing as a formal specialty, developing educational curricula, certification standards, and ethical guidelines. Lynch emphasized trauma-informed care while ensuring that medical examinations met legal evidentiary standards.

Forensic nursing encompasses sexual assault examination, death investigation, correctional nursing, and human rights documentation. Lynchâ€™s work professionalized these roles and ensured that healthcare providers could effectively collaborate with legal systems.

She also founded the International Association of Forensic Nurses (IAFN), promoting global standards and research in forensic nursing practice.

Today, forensic nurses play a vital role in victim advocacy, evidence collection, and multidisciplinary forensic teams. Lynchâ€™s legacy continues to shape healthcare, justice, and human rights systems worldwide.

Her work demonstrates how compassionate care and scientific rigor can coexist in forensic practice.</p>
