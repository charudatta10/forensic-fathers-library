<h1>Alec Jeffreys</h1>
<h2>Father of DNA Fingerprinting</h2>
<p>Sir Alec John Jeffreys (born 1950) is the inventor of DNA fingerprinting, one of the most transformative technologies in forensic science and criminal justice. Working at the University of Leicester in the 1980s, Jeffreys discovered that certain regions of DNA exhibit high variability between individuals while remaining stable within families.

In 1984, Jeffreys developed techniques to visualize these variable regions, producing distinctive banding patterns unique to each individual. This breakthrough provided an unprecedented level of accuracy for human identification, surpassing all previous biometric and biological methods.

DNA fingerprinting was first applied in a criminal case in 1986 in the United Kingdom, where it both exonerated an innocent suspect and identified the true perpetrator of two murders. This landmark case demonstrated the dual power of DNA evidenceâ€”to convict the guilty and protect the innocent.

Jeffreysâ€™ work rapidly reshaped policing, forensic laboratories, and legal systems worldwide. DNA profiling became central to criminal investigations, paternity testing, disaster victim identification, and immigration cases. His methods also prompted the creation of national DNA databases.

Beyond forensic science, Jeffreysâ€™ discovery revolutionized genetics, enabling advances in population biology, evolutionary studies, and medical diagnostics. He has also been a vocal advocate for ethical oversight and privacy protections in the use of genetic data.

Today, DNA profiling is considered the gold standard of forensic identification. Jeffreysâ€™ invention continues to underpin modern forensic genetics, next-generation sequencing methods, and global justice systems.</p>
